# Examples on Using Quarto Shortcodes to Generate Icons

Quarto has *a lot* of extensions. The ones that I feel deserve some focused attention is the set of shortcode extensions that produce icons. There are quite a few good ones so far! This little repository provides examples you can use for these high-quality extensions:

- `fontawesome`
- `material-icons`
- `bsicons`
- `academicons`
- `lordicon`
- `iconify`

Each of these icon extensions is covered in its own `.qmd` file. You can clone this repo and render those files with `quarto render <qmd-file>`. Check out the rendered doc! Edit the source and see what happens! Adapt these examples for your own work and profit.
